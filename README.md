# webpack-es6modules-practice

## About

I'm learning about Webpack and ES6 Modules from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-es6-modules), and started this while following the official tutorial from Webpack, then I did some extra stuff to practice more, specifically the constructors module.

## File Structure

```
webpack-es6modules-practice
├─ dist
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ main.js
│  └─ main.js.LICENSE.txt
├─ src
│  ├─ constructors.js
│  ├─ functionOne.js
│  ├─ index.js
│  └─ myName.js
├─ README.md
├─ package-lock.json
├─ package.json
└─ webpack.config.js
```

**`dist`**: distribution folder aka public, holding the bundled js file built by Webpack.

**`src`**: the source code of the project

**`package.json`**: file generated by `npm init -y` and updated after installing modules with `npm install moduleName --save / --save-dev`. It also holds npm scripts.

**`package-lock.json`**: same, but has more information about the specific versions of modules and their dependencies

**`webpack.config.js`**: custom config that can be used to tell Webpack which files to use as entry points, the output dir and file name etc.

## How To Use

Simply run `npm install` and open `dist/index.html`, then check the console. If you make changes, then run `npx webpack` or `npm run build` (`build` script from `package-lock.json`). Additionally, `npm run watch` will automatically build and run the new code as you make changes.
